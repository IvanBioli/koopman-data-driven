	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14889},
	abstract = {Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that globally linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, making their spectral information useful for understanding dynamics. However, Koopman operators can have continuous spectra and infinite-dimensional invariant subspaces, making computing their spectral information a considerable challenge. This paper describes data-driven algorithms with rigorous convergence guarantees for computing spectral information of Koopman operators from trajectory data. We introduce residual dynamic mode decomposition (ResDMD), which provides the first scheme for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators from snapshot data without spectral pollution. Using the resolvent operator and ResDMD, we also compute smoothed approximations of spectral measures associated with measure-preserving dynamical systems. We prove explicit convergence theorems for our algorithms, which can achieve high-order convergence even for chaotic systems, when computing the density of the continuous spectrum and the discrete spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithms on the tent map, Gauss iterated map, nonlinear pendulum, double pendulum, Lorenz system, and an \$11\$-dimensional extended Lorenz system. Finally, we provide kernelized variants of our algorithms for dynamical systems with a high-dimensional state-space. This allows us to compute the spectral measure associated with the dynamics of a protein molecule that has a 20,046-dimensional state-space, and compute nonlinear Koopman modes with error bounds for turbulent flow past aerofoils with Reynolds number \${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5\$ that has a 295,122-dimensional state-space.},

	abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical systems analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincar{\textbackslash}'e's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states". While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths, in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.},

	abstract = {We provide a framework for learning of dynamical systems rooted in the concept of representations and Koopman operators. The interplay between the two leads to the full description of systems that can be represented linearly in a finite dimension, based on the properties of the Koopman operator spectrum. The geometry of state space is connected to the notion of representation, both in the linear case - where it is related to joint level sets of eigenfunctions - and in the nonlinear representation case. As shown here, even nonlinear finite-dimensional representations can be learned using the Koopman operator framework, leading to a new class of representation eigenproblems. The connection to learning using neural networks is given. An extension of the Koopman operator theory to "static" maps between different spaces is provided. The effect of the Koopman operator spectrum on Mori-Zwanzig type representations is discussed.},

	abstract = {The Koopman operator is a linear operator that describes the evolution of scalar observables (i.e., measurement functions of the states) in an infinitedimensional Hilbert space. This operator theoretic point of view lifts the dynamics of a finite-dimensional nonlinear system to an infinite-dimensional function space where the evolution of the original system becomes linear. In this paper, we provide a brief summary of the Koopman operator theorem for nonlinear dynamics modeling and focus on analyzing several data-driven implementations using dynamical mode decomposition (DMD) for autonomous and controlled canonical problems. We apply the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to identify the leading Koopman eigenfunctions and approximate a finite-dimensional representation of the discovered linear dynamics. This allows us to apply linear control approaches towards nonlinear systems without linearization approximations around fixed points. We can then examine the fidelity of using a linear controller based on a Koopman operator approximated system on under-actuated systems with basic maneuvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this theory through numerical simulation on two classic dynamical systems are used to show DMD methods of evaluating and approximating the Koopman operator and its effectiveness at linearizing these systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12086},
	abstract = {The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems, 2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big-data and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.},

We then utilize conjugacy properties of Koopman eigenfunctions and the new notion of open eigenfunctions - defined on subsets of state space - to extend these results to nonlinear dynamical systems with an equilibrium. We provide a characterization of (global) center manifolds, center-stable and center-unstable manifolds in terms of joint zero level sets of families of Koopman operator eigenfunctions associated with the nonlinear system.After defining a new class of Hilbert spaces, that capture the on and off attractor properties of dissipative dynamics, and introduce the concept of Modulated Fock Spaces\vphantom{\{}\}, we develop spectral expansions for a class of dynamical systems possessing globally stable limit cycles and limit tori, with observables that are square-integrable in on-attractor variables and analytic in off-attractor variables.

These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid \& Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures.},

We review some elements of the spectral theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model – that can be deterministic or stochastic – are compared in some norm. Using the “statistical Takens theorem” proven in (Mezić, I. and Banaszuk, A.

This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science.

The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a "black box" integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the "stochastic Koopman operator" [1].

	abstract = {In this work, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves observable functions of the state-space of a dynamical system [Koopman 1931, PNAS]. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems [Williams et al. 2015, JNLS]. Choosing nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis using a new algorithm to determine terms in a dynamical system by sparse regression of the data in a nonlinear function space [Brunton et al. 2015, arxiv]; we show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate how to design optimal control laws for nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control on Koopman invariant subspaces.},

	abstract = {The Koopman Mode Decomposition (KMD) is a data-analysis technique which is often used to extract the spatio-temporal patterns of complex flows. In this paper, we use KMD to study the dynamics of the lid-driven flow in a two-dimensional square cavity based on theorems related to the spectral theory of the Koopman operator. We adapt two algorithms, from the classical Fourier and power spectral analysis, to compute the discrete and continuous spectrum of the Koopman operator for the post-transient flows. Properties of the Koopman operator spectrum are linked to the sequence of flow regimes occurring between \$Re=10000\$ and \$Re=30000\$, and changing the flow nature from steady to aperiodic. The Koopman eigenfunctions for different flow regimes, including flows with mixed spectra, are constructed using the assumption of ergodicity in the state space. The associated Koopman modes show remarkable robustness even as the temporal nature of the flow is changing substantially. We observe that KMD outperforms the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition in reconstruction of the flows with strong quasi-periodic components.c features are present in the flow.},

	abstract = {Pure and applied mathematicians, physicists, scientists, and engineers use matrices and operators and their eigenvalues in quantum mechanics, fluid mechanics, structural analysis, acoustics, ecology, numerical analysis, and many other areas. However, in some applications the usual analysis based on eigenvalues fails. For example, eigenvalues are often ineffective for analyzing dynamical systems such as fluid flow, Markov chains, ecological models, and matrix iterations. That's where this book comes in. This is the authoritative work on nonnormal matrices and operators, written by the authorities who made them famous. Each of the sixty sections is written as a self-contained essay. Each document is a lavishly illustrated introductory survey of its topic, complete with beautiful numerical experiments and all the right references. The breadth of included topics and the numerous applications that provide links between fields will make this an essential reference in mathematics and related sciences.},

	abstract = {Hyperbolic cross approximation is a special type of multivariate approximation. Recently, driven by applications in engineering, biology, medicine and other areas of science new challenging problems have appeared. The common feature of these problems is high dimensions. We present here a survey on classical methods developed in multivariate approximation theory, which are known to work very well for moderate dimensions and which have potential for applications in really high dimensions. The theory of hyperbolic cross approximation and related theory of functions with mixed smoothness are under detailed study for more than 50 years. It is now well understood that this theory is important both for theoretical study and for practical applications. It is also understood that both theoretical analysis and construction of practical algorithms are very difficult problems. This explains why many fundamental problems in this area are still unsolved. Only a few survey papers and monographs on the topic are published. This and recently discovered deep connections between the hyperbolic cross approximation (and related sparse grids) and other areas of mathematics such as probability, discrepancy, and numerical integration motivated us to write this survey. We try to put emphases on the development of ideas and methods rather than list all the known results in the area. We formulate many problems, which, to our knowledge, are open problems. We also include some very recent results on the topic, which sometimes highlight new interesting directions of research. We hope that this survey will stimulate further active research in this fascinating and challenging area of approximation theory and numerical analysis.},
