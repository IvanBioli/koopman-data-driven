# Semester Project - Koopman operator

## **TODO**
### Old parts
- [x] No need to store M dimensional matrices
- [x] How to compute B for Koopman modes?
- [x] Can use Krylov

### Kernelized EDMD
- [x] Idea of the Kernelized approach and why is it necessary
- [x] Explain from Machine Learning lecture notes the computational advantage of such an approach
- [x] Proposition 6.1 and proof 
- [x] How to obtain eigenmodes
- [x] Possible choices of the Kernel
- [x] Why ResDMD does not work like this
- [x] How to adapt
- [ ] (Try to find an example)
- [ ] (Implementation, maybe with old examples)
- [x] Write report

### Future developements
- [ ] Use an approach similar to the one of Kernelized ResDMD to find dictionary "automatically"
  - [ ] Compare with the already impemented examples
  - [ ] Test it with a new problem
  - [ ] Try to prove something
- [ ] Test also DMD and compare with others
- [ ] Test everything, in particular kernelized approaches, with a real problem
