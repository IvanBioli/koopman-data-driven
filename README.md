# Semester Project - Koopman operator

## Old parts
- [ ] No need to store M dimensional matrices
- [ ] How to compute B for Koopman modes?
  - [ ] First approach, projection if doable
  - [ ] Second approach, like in Kernelized EDMD paper
- [ ] Can use Krylov

## Kernelized EDMD
- [ ] Idea of the Kernelized approach and why is it necessary
- [ ] Explain from Machine Learning lecture notes the computational advantage of such an approach
- [ ] Proposition 6.1 and proof 
- [ ] Possible choices of the Kernel
- [ ] Why ResDMD does not work like this
- [ ] How to adapt
- [ ] (Try to find an example)
- [ ] (Implementation, maybe with old examples)
- [ ] Write report

## Future developements
- [ ] Test also DMD and compare with others
- [ ] Test everything with a real problem
