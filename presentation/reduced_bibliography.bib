	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14889},
	abstract = {Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that globally linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, making their spectral information useful for understanding dynamics. However, Koopman operators can have continuous spectra and infinite-dimensional invariant subspaces, making computing their spectral information a considerable challenge. This paper describes data-driven algorithms with rigorous convergence guarantees for computing spectral information of Koopman operators from trajectory data. We introduce residual dynamic mode decomposition (ResDMD), which provides the first scheme for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators from snapshot data without spectral pollution. Using the resolvent operator and ResDMD, we also compute smoothed approximations of spectral measures associated with measure-preserving dynamical systems. We prove explicit convergence theorems for our algorithms, which can achieve high-order convergence even for chaotic systems, when computing the density of the continuous spectrum and the discrete spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithms on the tent map, Gauss iterated map, nonlinear pendulum, double pendulum, Lorenz system, and an \$11\$-dimensional extended Lorenz system. Finally, we provide kernelized variants of our algorithms for dynamical systems with a high-dimensional state-space. This allows us to compute the spectral measure associated with the dynamics of a protein molecule that has a 20,046-dimensional state-space, and compute nonlinear Koopman modes with error bounds for turbulent flow past aerofoils with Reynolds number \${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5\$ that has a 295,122-dimensional state-space.},

	abstract = {The description of coherent features of fluid flow is essential to our understanding of fluid-dynamical and transport processes. A method is introduced that is able to extract dynamic information from flow fields that are either generated by a (direct) numerical simulation or visualized/measured in a physical experiment. The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07597},
	abstract = {We examine spectral operator-theoretic properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems with globally stable attractors. Using the Kato Decomposition we develop a spectral expansion for general linear autonomous dynamical systems with analytic observables, and define the notion of generalized eigenfunctions of the associated Koopman operator. We interpret stable, unstable and center subspaces in terms of zero level sets of generalized eigenfunctions. We then utilize conjugacy properties of Koopman eigenfunctions and the new notion of open eigenfunctions - defined on subsets of state space - to extend these results to nonlinear dynamical systems with an equilibrium. We provide a characterization of (global) center manifolds, center-stable and center-unstable manifolds in terms of joint zero level sets of families of Koopman operator eigenfunctions associated with the nonlinear system.After defining a new class of Hilbert spaces, that capture the on and off attractor properties of dissipative dynamics, and introduce the concept of Modulated Fock Spaces\vphantom{\{}\}, we develop spectral expansions for a class of dynamical systems possessing globally stable limit cycles and limit tori, with observables that are square-integrable in on-attractor variables and analytic in off-attractor variables. We discuss definitions of stable, unstable and global center manifolds in such nonlinear systems with (quasi)-periodic attractors in terms of zero level sets of Koopman operator eigenfunctions. We define the notion of isostables for a general class of nonlinear systems. We provide a simple example of a measure-preserving system that is not chaotic but has continuous spectrum, and discuss experimental observations of spectrum on such systems. We define the coherent principal dimension for a class of datasets based on the lattice-type principal spectrum of the associated Koopman operator.},

	abstract = {We present a technique for describing the global behaviour of complex nonlinear flows by decomposing the flow into modes determined from spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator associated with the full nonlinear system. These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid \& Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures.},
